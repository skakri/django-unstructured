Notes
============

Wiki-base is built upon `wiki <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wiki>`_ but is not exactly the same.

For example, wiki-base doesn't use ``django-notify`` (hooks to Signals are
available to achieve similar functionality), so original ``wiki`` plugins may
not work.

There also will be some additions - Article content will be split
out to editable blocks (like in MediaWiki) which will be reordable.

Why is it named wiki-base?

It's a placeholder name, it may change.
